# RxpsG
Processing tool for X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy Data

The new RxpsG_3.2 version differs from the previous RxpsG package because the graphic user interfaces (GUIs) are generated directly using the tclTK commands. This has the advantage of avoiding the two libaries 'gWidgets2' and 'gWidgets2tcltk' rendering the software lighter, and faster in generating the GUIs.

RxpsG installation

    Install R and Rstudio on your computer

    Verify all is working by typing  'version'  you should get something like:

    day 16
    svn rev 84548
    language R
    version.string R version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16) nickname Beagle Scouts

RxpsG installation:

    Click on the RxpsG_xx.xx.tar.gz package and download. Exit the unzipping procedure if it starts automatically.

    Control in the Dowloads folder the RxpsG_xx.xx.tar.gz package is present (it could be the .gz extension is lacking do not worry).

    Run RStudio

    Under RStudio copy and paste the following command to INSTALL THE REQUIRED LIBRARIES:

    install.packages(c("digest", "import", "latticeExtra", "minpack.lm", "signal", "SparseM"), repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org", dependencies=TRUE)

    Control that installation proceeds correctly without errors;
    
    Some options (Automatic Element recognition, Wavelets filtering, Model Fitting) require the installation of 
    the additional packges: baseline, FME, rootSolve, wavelets. If interested copy and paste the following command:
    
    install.packages(c("baseline", "FME", "rootSolve", "wavelets", repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org", dependencies=TRUE)


    To INSTALL RxpsG_3.3 copy and paste the following command:

    install.packages("C:/Path-To-Tar.Gz/RxpsG_3.3.tar.gz", type = "source", dependencies=TRUE)

    where Path-To-Tar.Gz is the path to the dowloaded RxpsG_3.3.tar.gz file.

    N.B. if installation blocks at level:
         '** testing if installed package can be loaded from temporary location '
         control if behind the RStudio window a GUI is waiting for your response

To run RxpsG, in RStudio select the PACKAGE pain (generally on the right of the RStudio console) and select the RxpsG package. This should automatically load and run the software.
The command   'xps()'   also starts the RxpsG program.
